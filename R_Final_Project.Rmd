## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

#interaction of special requests x booking changes, as it's possible they might compound risk for cancellation:

#or2
```

# Final Analysis.
```{r}
# Our results from the graph show us that the main reasons for cancellation are as follows:

# A.) No deposit and No refund for Room Type-A.
# B.) Transient Customer.
# C.) Tickets being booked online by a TA(Travel Agent) or a Group.
# D.) Large No. of special requests being made by Transient Customers.
# E.) Meal is BB(Bed and Breakfast) or HB(Half board (breakfast and one other meal – usually dinner)
# F.) Portugal has the most no. of cancellations being done.

# In comparison with Apriori Rules we have:

# A.) DepositType=Non Refund, CustomerType=Transient
# B.) MarketSegment=Groups, DepositType=Non Refund, CustomerType=Transient
# C.) AssignedRoomType=A, DepositType=Non Refund, CustomerType=Transient
# D.) Country=PRT, DepositType=Non Refund, CustomerType=Transient
# E.) DepositType=Non Refund, CustomerType=Transient, TotalOfSpecialRequests=0
